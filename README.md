## Visual Studio Code Community Discussions

Community discussions is the place to discuss VS Code's extension platform, ask questions, help other members of the community, and get answers.

[👉 Jump into VS Code extension development discussions](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-discussions/discussions).

We are scoping discussions to just extension development to learn, experiment, and grow sustainably.

Other places to participate with VS Code:

- 🔎 `"Help: Report Issue"` is VS Code's built-in command to 🐛 report bugs, 🐌 performance issues, and 💡 feature requests.
- 🏠 [VS Code repo](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode) for triaging issues and upvoting [feature requests](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=533482), and [contributing](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/wiki/How-to-Contribute).
- 📚 [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/vscode) for general VS Code questions.
- 💬 [Extension Dev Slack](https://aka.ms/vscode-dev-community) for chatting with other extension authors.

### We need your participation

… to create a welcoming and inspiring community. [Microsoft's Open Source Code of Conduct](https://opensource.microsoft.com/codeofconduct/) applies here, in short **please be kind and remember that there are real people on the other side of the keyboard.** 

Also:

- As we begin to build this community, we ask that you limit conversations to the categories available (more categories will be released as the community grows!)

- Before opening a new discussion, please search existing posts to see if the topic thread already exists.

- Please do not use this as a place to `@` your favorite VS Code contributor to get an extra bump on a feature request. Spoiler: it won't work.

Happy discussing! :)

### FAQ

**How can I help?**
Answer questions with empathy and kindness. Keep the community welcoming by giving contructive feedback and reporting unacceptable behavior. Reach out if you like to help with moderation.

**Why are there just categories for extension development?**
We want to start small, and the extension author community is just the right size. Meanwhile [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/visual-studio-code?tab=Newest) continues to serve most other questions.

**When will more categories be added?**
As we learn what works well, tweak our moderation process, and see the community grow before expanding topics. If we see moderation becoming a burden on the team we will also consider take action.
